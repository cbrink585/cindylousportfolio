This is a portfolio of my work in the Master of Science in Data Science coursework.


Project 1 is Global Climate Change- the purpose of the project was to illustrate how decisions based in science can be easily described and illustrated by telling the story of the data.  The dataset was from a remote Hawaiian location.  The data was explored and an used in the generation of a linear regression model.  The data story was generated and the model run with the inclusion of predictions.

Project 2 is wine prediction using a KNN nearest neighbor algorithm.  The data is visualized adn explored, and leveraged for the KNN model to predict the 5 closest wine choices based upon the wine tasting experts numerical ratings.  Only the wines rated at or above 80 were included in the dataset.  This project describes the first phase implementation of what could easily be expanded and include a survey generated rating for wines purchased.

Project 3 is
