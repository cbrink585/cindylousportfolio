This is a portfolio of my work in the Master of Science in Data Science coursework.


Project 1 is Global Climate Change- the purpose of the project was to illustrate how decisions based in science can be easily described and illustrated by telling the story of the data.  The dataset was from a remote Hawaiian location.  The data was explored and an used in the generation of a linear regression model.  The data story was generated and the model run with the inclusion of predictions.

Project 2 is wine prediction using a KNN nearest neighbor algorithm.  The data is visualized adn explored, and leveraged for the KNN model to predict the 5 closest wine choices based upon the wine tasting experts numerical ratings.  Only the wines rated at or above 80 were included in the dataset.  This project describes the first phase implementation of what could easily be expanded and include a survey generated rating for wines purchased.

Project 3 is a fake news detector project that leverages a dataset of a news feed and explores the data and clean up things like missing data.  The test data is transformed in to numpy arrays, vectorized and fit to a passiveaggressiveClassifier.  The model was not that accurate (17%) and additional models should be investigated.

Project 4 is a credit fraud detector and includes data visualization and manipulation to remove empty data fields.  The data is explored and eventually coverted to dummy variables in arrays.  In the project I fitted the data to a logistic regression model and displayed precision, recall, the f1-score and also fit to a randomforestclassifier displaying the same evaluation metrics for comparision.

Project 5 is an Airline Dashboard focused on the return to passenger travel for US passengers.  The display includesline charts and bar charts illustrating the data in which safety is acceptable and options are available for flexible travelling.

Project 6 is a data manipulation project using bible text datasets optained by webscraping data and manipulating the data into a database and displaying the new dataset.

Project 7 includes Python, R and Tableau visualizations of common graphs including bar charts, pie charts, bar plots, donut charts, stacked bar charts, using each programming methods and Tableau.

Project 8 is a basic visualization of data using R Markdown to display an output similar to a report generated.  Various datasets are leveraged to complete the display that one would include in report generation tasks.

Project 9 includes various displays of data using Python that is representative of the homweork assignments. It includes the code to display scatter plots, and correlation coefficients along with a Linear Regression model with the p-value.

Project 10 is a movie recommender using KNN nearest neighbors algorithm in which the closest 10 movies are provided when you select one movie.  The dataset is a set of movie ratings from imdb, and is imported and cleaned to be fit to the model.
